While Loops:

    Counting Up:
    Write a program that uses a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.

    Counting Down:
    Write a program that uses a while loop to print numbers from 10 to 1.

    User Input:
    Create a program that asks the user to enter a number. Use a while loop to print the square of that number and ask the user if they want to enter another number. Continue the loop until the user chooses to exit.

For Loops:

    Print Even Numbers:
    Write a program using a for loop to print all even numbers from 1 to 10.

    Multiplication Table:
    Ask the user to enter a number and print its multiplication table (up to 10) using a for loop.

    Sum of Numbers:
    Write a program to calculate and print the sum of all numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.

Combined Use of While and For Loops:

    Nested Loop - Multiplication Table:
    Use a nested loop (combination of while and for) to print the multiplication table from 1 to 5.

    Guess the Number:
    Generate a random number between 1 and 10. Ask the user to guess the number using a while loop. Provide feedback if the guessed number is too high or too low. Continue the loop until the user guesses correctly.

    Factorial Calculation:
    Ask the user to enter a number and calculate its factorial using a for loop. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers up to n.

    Pattern Printing:
    Use nested loops to print the following pattern:


    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****    

Remember to encourage students to experiment and modify the exercises to enhance their understanding. These exercises cover a range of loop scenarios and can help solidify their grasp on while and for loops in Python.
