1. Input Validation:
Write a program that takes user input for a number. 
Handle the ValueError by printing a message if the input is not a valid number.

2. Index Error:
Create a list and attempt to access an element at an index that is out of bounds. 
Handle the IndexError and print a custom error message.

3. Custom Exception:
Define a custom exception class called MyError. 
Write a function that raises this exception with a custom error message.

4. Write a function that takes a dictionary and a key as parameters. 
Handle the KeyError by printing a custom error message if the key is not present in the dictionary.

5. Write a function that takes a list and checks if all elements are positive. 
Use an assert statement to raise an 
AssertionError with a custom message if any element is not positive.

6. Multiple Exceptions:
Write a function that takes two numbers as input and performs a complex mathematical operation. 
Handle both ValueError and ZeroDivisionError separately with custom error messages.
