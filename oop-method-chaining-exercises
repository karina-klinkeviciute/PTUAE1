1. calculator

Create a calculator that would have an __init__ method, in which it would set an initial value (default - 0).
It should also have methods for adding, subtracting, dividing amd multiplication.

All methods should be available to chain. The result of each calculation could be used in the second one.

The calculation could look like this:

result = Calculator(10).add(5).multiply(2).subtract(3).divide(2).value
print(result)
