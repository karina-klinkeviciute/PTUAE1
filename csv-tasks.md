1. Write a Python script that reads a CSV file containing sales data 
(date, product, quantity, price) and prints out only the rows where the
quantity sold is greater than 10.

2. Write a Python script that reads a CSV file containing employee information
(name, salary) and increases the salary
of each employee by 10%. Then, write the updated information back to the 
same CSV file.

3. Given two CSV files containing student information (name, age, grade) 
and (name, year of study), write a Python script that merges the two files based 
on the student's name and prints out the combined information.

4. Write a Python script that reads a CSV file containing student information 
(name, age, grade) where some rows may have missing data. Handle these 
missing values gracefully, such as by replacing them with a default 
value or skipping those rows.

5. Write a Python script that reads a CSV file containing student information 
and validates each row to ensure that the age is a positive integer and 
the grade is a valid letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F). Print out any rows
that fail the validation check.

6. Write a Python script that reads a CSV file containing sales data 
and calculates the total revenue generated by each product. 
Then, write the results to a new CSV file with columns for 
product name and total revenue.
