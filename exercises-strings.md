1. Word Count:
Write a Python function that takes a string as input and counts the number of words in the string. Words are separated by whitespace.

2. String Concatenation:
Write a Python function that concatenates two strings together and returns the result.

3. Remove Duplicates:
Write a Python function that takes a string as input and removes any duplicate characters, maintaining the original order of characters.

4. Capitalize First Letter:
Write a Python function that takes a string as input and capitalizes the first letter of each word in the string.

5. Check Anagrams:
Write a Python function that checks if two strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

6. Write a Python function to get a string made of the first 2 and last 2 characters of a given string. If the string length is less than 2, the result should be an empty string.
Sample String : 'w3resource'
Expected Result : 'w3ce'
Sample String : 'w3'
Expected Result : 'w3w3'
Sample String : ' w'
Expected Result : Empty String 

7. Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself.
Sample String : 'restart'
Expected Result : 'resta$t'

8. Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should be at least 3). If the given string already ends with 'ing', add 'ly' instead. If the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged.
Sample String : 'abc'
Expected Result : 'abcing'
Sample String : 'string'
Expected Result : 'stringly'

9. Write a Python program to remove the nth index character from a nonempty string.
